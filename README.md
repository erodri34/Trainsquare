Trainsquare is a consumer educational and skills platform based on community-sharing knowledge, which allows users to both host in-person workshops and discover and book courses, lessons and activities.
Trainsquare is an MVP and due to the proprietary nature of the code I can only provide code snippets of my code.

This repository contains SQL, .NET, and React code.

My role was to create a user's password reset function. I created the coding from the backend to the frontend. Below are processes I utilized to create the user's password reset function

    ● Created the necessary procedures in SQL utilizing joins, foreign keys and pagination

    ● Construct RESTful API endpoint controllers, services and interfaces using .NET (C#) in order to connect application features to SQL Server relational database; tested with Postman

    ● Utilized ReactJS and Bootstrap to create front-end components such as modals, forms, and buttons; allowing for a user-friendly interface

    ● Focused on best practices using proper naming convention and casing to avoid compiler issues with team member’s code

    ● Maintained workflow using GitBash and GitHub for repo management

    ● Created new branches to maintain organization throughout the project

    ● Performed commits and pull requests to secure consistency and quality

    ● Collaborated with a team of 11 developers using source control and AGILE methodologies, including daily standups, code reviews and usage of Git and GitHub for source control and repo management
